Although cryptocurrency trading has declined due to the impact of the global economy in 2021, the market value of cryptocurrency has recently resumed an upward trend, but the increase has slowed down compared to the past. In October 2022, the global cryptocurrency market value was approximately US$918 billion, and Bitcoin remains the most preferred digital currency among traders.

Brokers are still enthusiastic about setting up cryptocurrency exchanges. The main process steps and precautions that can be referenced when setting up cryptocurrency exchanges are as follows:

Select a jurisdiction to register

Setting up a cryptocurrency exchange requires registration at the place of registration and completion of a series of compliance procedures. The United States, 
Japan and other regions have very strict regulations on publicly offered cryptocurrency exchanges. Since there are currently no unified international rules for operating cryptocurrency exchanges,
you need to decide the jurisdiction in which to operate the exchange based on the laws and policies of different regions and the region where you plan to conduct cryptocurrency trading business. 
Common jurisdictions include Canada, Japan, Cyprus and other offshore islands. As countries pay more and more attention to the regulation of cryptocurrency transactions, compliance issues have become very important.
